# multipeer-hell

This is a small app that I made to understand how to utilize MultipeerConnectivity in Swift in the context of SwiftUI. The app connects to any nearby peers also running the app. Once connected to a session, peers are able to change their background color on their own device as well as in the "window" representing them on the peers' apps.

3 phones not connected:

3 phones in the connected session, one changed it's background:

All 3 changed:

I ripped off the idea from [ConnectivityNightmare](https://github.com/Sfuso/multipeerConnectivity), which appears to be some people trying to learn the same thing and having the exact same difficulties.
